A secure, transparent, and user-friendly **web-based electronic voting platform** designed for universities.  
It enables administrators to create and manage elections, students to vote online once anonymously, and the public to view results — all through a centralized and protected system.

## 🎯 Project Overview  

The **University E-Voting System** modernizes the traditional paper-based voting process.  
It ensures **fairness**, **security**, and **anonymity** while simplifying election management for administrators and providing accessibility for students.

### Key Goals  
- Prevent duplicate or fraudulent votes  
- Maintain voter privacy and data integrity  
- Deliver instant, accurate results  
- Provide transparency through verifiable audit logs  

---

## ⚙️ Key Features  

### 👩‍💼 Admin Panel  
- Create and manage elections  
- Approve or reject candidate applications  
- Upload and verify voter lists  
- Generate secure, one-time voting tokens  
- Publish election results instantly  

### 👨‍🎓 Voter Portal  
- Secure login with university credentials  
- Cast a single anonymous vote  
- Receive confirmation after successful submission  

### 🧾 Non-Identifying Audit Logs  
The system automatically records important activities — such as votes being cast or results being published — **without storing any voter’s identity or vote choice**.  
This ensures full transparency **without breaking voter anonymity**.

**Example:**
✅ *No personal data (like voter name or ID) is ever logged.*

✅ **Instructions:**  
1. Open your GitHub repo.  
2. Create a file named `README.md`.  
3. Paste everything above.  
4. Commit → Push → Done 🎉  

This will render beautifully with **emojis, badges, code blocks, and tables** — exactly like a professional open-source project page.  

Would you like me to also add a **visual system diagram (ASCII or Mermaid chart)** section showing how Admin, Voter, and Database interact? It looks great on GitHub and adds an academic touch.
